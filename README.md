# ChargeSimulator
Simulates positive, negative, and neutral charges for young physics students. Click and drag onto the charges on the left side to put them on the screen, then click the red box to start and stop the simulation.

This simulation uses real physics equations to ensure the simulations accuracy. It is a completed project.
